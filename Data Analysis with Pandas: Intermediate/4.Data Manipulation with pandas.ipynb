    "# 1: Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous mission, we learned how to explore a pandas DataFrame. In this mission, we'll explore how to manipulate a DataFrame and make transformations to it. We'll continue to work with the same data set from the USDA on nutritional information. We'll build a basic nutritional index for people who want to eat high-protein, low-fat foods. The \"Lipid_Tot_(g)\" column contains each food's total fat content, and the \"Protein_(g)\" (in grams) contains each food's total protein content (in grams). Let's use the following formula to score each food in our data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "While this formula is by no means scientific, it will act as a guide as we explore pandas further.\n",

    "\n",

    "To practice what we learned in the previous mission:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the pandas library.\n",
    "2. Read food_info.csv into a DataFrame object named food_info.\n",
    "3. Use the DataFrame.columns attribute, followed by the Index.tolist() method, to return a list containing only the column names.\n",
    "3. Assign the resulting list to col_names, and use the print() function to display the value.\n",
    "4. Display the first three rows of food_info.\n"

    "The columns in the data set use different units (kilo-calories, milligrams, etc.). As a result, the range of values varies greatly between columns. For example, the \"Vit_A_IU\" column ranges from 0 to 100000, while the \"Fiber_TD_(g)\" column ranges from 0 to 79. For certain calculations, columns like \"Vit_A_IU\" can have a greater effect on the result, due to the scale of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many ways to normalize data, one of the simplest ways is to divide all of the values in a column by that column's maximum value. This way, all of the columns will range from 0 to 1. To calculate the maximum value of a column, we use the Series.max() method. In the following code, we use the Series.max() method to calculate the largest value in the \"Energ_Kcal\" column, and assign it to max_calories:\n",
