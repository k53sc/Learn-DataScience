    "# 1: Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next two missions, we'll dive into some of pandas' internals to better understand how it does things under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three key data structures in pandas are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Series objects (collections of values)\n",
    "    DataFrames (collections of Series objects)\n",
    "    Panels (collections of DataFrame objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on the Series object in this mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series objects use NumPy arrays for fast computation, but add valuable features to them for analyzing data. While NumPy arrays use an integer index, for example, Series objects can use other index types, such as a string index. Series objects also allow for mixed data types, and use the NaN Python value for handling missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Series object can hold many data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    float - For float values\n",
    "    int - For integer values\n",
    "    bool - For Boolean values\n",
    "    datetime64[ns] - For date & time, without time zone\n",
    "    datetime64[ns, tz] - For date & time, with time zone\n",
    "    timedelta[ns] - For representing differences in dates & times (seconds, minutes, etc.)\n",
    "    category - For categorical values\n",
    "    object - For string values\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into further depth, let's introduce the data set we'll be working with. The FiveThirtyEight team recently released a data set containing scores for all movies that have substantive user and critic reviews on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and Fandango. We'll be working with the file fandango_score_comparison.csv, which you can download from their Github repository. Here are some of the columns in the data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "    FILM - Film name\n",
    "    RottenTomatoes - Average critic score on Rotten Tomatoes\n",
    "    RottenTomatoes_User - Average user score on Rotten Tomatoes\n",
    "    RT_norm - Average critic score on Rotten Tomatoes (normalized to a 0 to 5-point system)\n",
    "    RT_user-norm - Average user score on Rotten Tomatoes (normalized to a 0 to 5-point system)\n",
    "    Metacritic - Average critic score on Metacritic\n",
    "    Metacritic_User - Average user score on Metacritic\n",

    "A column is really a vector of values. For this reason, we often want to transform an entire column in a data set. Series objects offer robust support for vectorized operations, which enable us to run computations over an entire column very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since pandas builds on NumPy, it takes advantage of NumPy's vectorizaton capabilities. These capabilities generate incredibly optimized, low level code in the C programming language to loop over the values. Using a traditional for loop would be much slower, especially for large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use any of the standard Python arithmetic operators (+, -, *, and /) to transform each of the values in a Series object. If we wanted to transform the Rotten Tomatoes scores from a 100-point scale to a 10-point scale, for example, we could use the Python division operator (/) to divide the Series by 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "    series_custom/10\n",

    "This will return a new Series object where each value is 1/10 of the original value. We can even use NumPy functions to transform and run calculations over Series objects:\n",

    "The values in a Series object are part of an ndarray, the core data type in NumPy. Applying some NumPy functions to a Series object will return a new Series object, while other functions will return a single value. NumPy's documentation http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sin.html#numpy.sin gives us a good sense of the return value for each function. If a particular NumPy function usually returns an ndarray, it will return a Series object instead when we apply it to a Series.\n",

With Series objects, pandas implicitly preserves the link between the index labels and the values across operations and transformations, unless we explicitly break it. With DataFrame objects, the values link to the index labels and the column labels. Pandas also preserves these links, unless we explicitly break them (by reassigning or editing a column or index label, for example).\n",
