    "In the last mission, we began investigating possible relationships between SAT scores and demographic factors. In order to do this, we acquired several data sets about New York City public schools. We manipulated these data sets, and found that we could combine them all using the DBN column. All of the data sets are currently stored as keys in the data dictionary. Each individual data set is a pandas dataframe.\n",

    "The first thing we'll need to do in preparation for the merge is condense some of the data sets. In the last mission, we noticed that the values in the DBN column were unique in the sat_results data set. Other data sets like class_size had duplicate DBN values, however.\n",

    "While the main data set we want to analyze, sat_results, has unique DBN values for every high school in New York City, other data sets aren't as clean. A single row in the sat_results data set may match multiple columns in the class_size data set, for example. This situation will create problems, because we don't know which of the multiple entries in the class_size data set we should combine with the single matching entry in sat_results. Here's a diagram that illustrates the problem:\n",

    "# 14: Filling in Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the inner joins resulted in 116 fewer rows in sat_results. This is because pandas couldn't find the DBN values that existed in sat_results in the other data sets. While this is worth investigating, we're currently looking for high-level correlations, so we don't need to dive into which DBNs are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also have noticed that we now have many columns with null (NaN) values. This is because we chose to do left joins, where some columns may not have had data. The data set also had some missing values to begin with. If we hadn't performed a left join, all of the rows with missing data would have been lost in the merge process, which wouldn't have left us with many high schools in our data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to handle missing data, and we'll cover them in more detail later on. For now, we'll just fill in the missing values with the overall mean for the column, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, the mean of the first column is (1800 + 1600 + 2200 + 2300) / 4, or 1975, and the mean of the second column is (20 + 30 + 30 + 50) / 4, or 32.5. We replace the missing values with the means of their respective columns, which allows us to proceed with analyses that can't handle missing values (like correlations).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can fill in missing data in pandas using the pandas.DataFrame.fillna() method. This method will replace any missing values in a dataframe with the values we specify. We can compute the mean of every column using the pandas.DataFrame.mean() method. If we pass the results of the df.mean() method into the df.fillna() method, pandas will fill in the missing values in each column with the mean of that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how we would accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    means = df.mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "    df = df.fillna(means)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if a column consists entirely of null or NaN values, pandas won't be able to fill in the missing values when we use the df.fillna() method along with the df.mean() method, because there won't be a mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should fill any NaN or null values that remain after the initial replacement with the value 0. We can do this by passing 0 into the df.fillna() method."
